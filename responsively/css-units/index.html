      <h1>CSS Units</h1>
      <p>
        We must make a design and have it work on every device, from a watch
        screen to a 80" TV. We will work our way up from getting a design to
        simply work on a single screen size to being able to get it to work on
        any device.
      </p>
      <h2>What we will be covering in this module:</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>How to approach a layout</li>
        <li>CSS units (absolute, relative and percentages)</li>
        <li>Flex box basics ( our layout tool)</li>
        <li>Media query basics (adapting to different screen sizes)</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>
        There are different types of units that we can use
      </h2>
      <h3>
        CSS units come in a few different flavors:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Absolute units</li>
        <li>Relative</li>
        <li>percentages</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Absolute units are the easiest to understand</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Pixels(px)</li>
        <li>pt, cm, mm, in etc</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Percentage</h2>
      <p>Percentages are mainly used for width, and are pretty easy to understand</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relative to their parent (except on height, where things get weird).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Relative units</h2>
      <p>There are two types of relative units</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Relative fo font-size:<br>
            - em and rem (and many other less common ones)
        </li> 
        <li>Relative fo viewport. Viewport is browser window. <br>
            - vw<br>
            - vh<br>
            - vmin <br>
            - vmax <br>


        </li> 
      </ul>
    </div>
    <style>
      .card-importants-notes {
        background: #c7c4c4;
        border: 1px dotted #000;
        margin: 100px auto;
        width: 560px;
        padding: 45px;
      }
